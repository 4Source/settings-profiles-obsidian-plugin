Allows you to create various global settings profiles. You can sync them between different vaults. To keep all your settings in sync, you'll never have to manually adjust them again for every vault you have or create in the future.

# Demo
![SettingsProfiles-VaultSwitchDemo_v5](https://github.com/4Source/settings-profiles-obsidian-plugin/assets/38220764/5c68105f-6613-4ba6-ab6b-c581b4badab7)
The demo shows creating a new profile for an existing vault with a theme set and plugin installed. Then a new vault is created and settings profiles are installed. After installation, the previously created profile will be automatically recognized. This is selected and loads all settings including themes and plugins. The newly created vault will then have the same settings as the existing vault.


# Usage

You can do this in the settings tab. Just click on the "Add new Profile". Give it a name and select whitch options should be enabled. To switch between profiles click on "Switch to Profile" obsidian should reload.

# Features
- Multible profile settings
